# My first Mini-Project!


## Objective

This was an instructor guided mini-project to bring
all of the skills I've learned together into one example.

It can also be used as a basis for my own resume page, 
and as a place to pull certain elements to use in other prjects.

## Tools/Technologies

I used HTML and CSS languages, Font Awesome fonts and Icons, along with Bootstrap4. 

This mini-project is currently hosted on GitHub pages.
